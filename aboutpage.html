            <p class="four">Website development is a catch-all term for the work that goes into building a website.
                <br>This includes everything from markup and coding to scripting,<br> network configuration, and CMS
                development. While web development typically refers to web markup and coding, <br> website development
                includes all related development tasks, such as client-side scripting, server-side scripting, <br>server
                and network security configuration, eCommerce development, and content management system (CMS)
                development.

            <h4 class="three">Why is web development important?</h4>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p class="four">The Internet isn’t going anywhere. In fact, it’s become a portal and primary method of
                research, connection, education, and entertainment in the world.<br> As of 2021, there were 4.66 billion
                global Internet users — more than half the world’s population.<br>
                Given the rapidly-increasing number of Internet users, it’s no surprise that web development is a
                rapidly expanding industry. <br>Between now and 2030, the employment of web developers is expected to
                grow by 13%, much faster than most other technology careers.
